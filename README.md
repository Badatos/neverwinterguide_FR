# Introduction

Welcome, Dungeon Masters! If you're looking at this guide, you're undoubtedly looking for information or resources related to the captivatingly magical city of Neverwinter. This guide was created to provide DMs with the necessary information about Neverwinter as it exists for the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, particularly in the early 1490s DR. {.no-fancy}

Many Dungeon Masters have started their campaigns, and often their role as a DM, using either of the wonderful [Lost Mine of Phandelver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop) or [Dragon of Icespire Peak](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip) starter adventures. While these adventures provide plenty to do in the small town of Phandalin and its surrounding areas, they're also placed *temptingly* close to the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast. It's not uncommon for players to ask to visit the city of Neverwinter. This can feel overwhelmingly difficult for unprepared DMs to manage (especially newer DMs). Not a tremendous amount has been described about Neverwinter as it exists in the Fifth Edition of D&D, so a diligent DM might feel compelled to scour through loads of out-of-print material. This guide attempts to consolidate much of that information and help all seeking to venture into Neverwinter.

## About this Guide

This guide has two primary goals: 
1. To provide accurate information about Neverwinter as it comes from official Dungeons & Dragons Source Books and Adventures. Information that is *not* from such a source will be clearly marked. 
2. To provide Dungeon Masters with a set of tools and ideas to help them craft an adventure should their table decide to wander into Neverwinter.

A secondary goal of this guide is to be compatible with the wealth of existing official adventures out there. In particular, the homebrew ideas and shops are crafted with both of the two starting adventures, [Lost Mine of Phandelver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop) and [Dragon of Icespire Peak](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip), in mind.
